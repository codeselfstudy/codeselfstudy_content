Code Self Study is a community of people who like to self-study programming in groups. We've hosted almost 500 events so far, and we're working on creating a new kind of <a href="/school/">educational center for computer programming</a> in Berkeley.

We meet every Wednesday and Saturday in Berkeley. Visit our main meetup group to RSVP to upcoming events.
