Content
=======

The content for the website.

It's kept in a separate repo, because the content is specific to the website, and it isn't under the same license as the code.

This file has a .txt extension to prevent it from being read in by Gatsby.

The images directory is named `blog`, because that's how it's referred to with the symlink from Gatsby.
