At the moment, these are the colorschemes I'm using in Vim.

<h2>Dark</h2>

Normally, my terminal is green text on a black background. My vim theme in that case is twilight256. It looks like this:

<img src="/files/vim-dark-colorscheme-twilight256.png" width="940" height="659" alt="Vim colorscheme twilight 256" />

<h2>Light</h2>

When I'm in a bright environment, I set the terminal colors to black text on white background. In that case I use the louver theme for vim, which looks like this:

<img src="/files/vim-colorscheme-louver.png" width="944" height="796" alt="vim color scheme louver" />

They are working well for me.
