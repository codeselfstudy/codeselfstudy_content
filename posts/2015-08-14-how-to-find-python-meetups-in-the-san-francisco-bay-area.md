(and probably more, if you search Meetup.com for "Python")

If I missed any local Python groups, leave a comment below and I'll update the lists.

<h2>Managing Information Overload</h2>

I'm actually a member of <strike>over 600</strike> almost 1,000 groups on Meetup.com. I filter the notification messages into a "MEETUP" folder. An email filter stars any messages that contain words like "Python" and other topics that I'm interested in. This actually works for any kind of meetup. I probably get about 100 emails per day from Meetup.com, but the stars next to interesting events let me skim the list quickly and delete the rest.

Gmail allows one to add "labels" to messages based on things like email address. I also have Thunderbird add stars based on keywords like Python, JavaScript, and Vim:
