This morning I was trying to write a quick blog post here, but when I submitted it, I got this error from Google Chrome:

<img src="/files/chrome-xss.png" width="720" height="447" alt="chrome-xss.png" />

<blockquote>This page isnÂ’t working

Chrome detected unusual code on this page and blocked it to protect your personal information (for example, passwords, phone numbers, and credit cards).
Try visiting the site's homepage.
ERR_BLOCKED_BY_XSS_AUDITOR</blockquote>

I know for sure that there was no personal information in the submitted content, because it was a list of MathJax tutorials along with a few code examples.

Not only did Chrome block me from posting the blog post, it deleted the history of my blog post from the browser so that I couldn't recover my text by using the back button.

Is anyone else encountering this problem? In the meantime, I will have to use <a href="https://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a> to submit the blog post.

Update: it happened again with a different site when I tried to post embedded YouTube videos (which use iframe elements).

Update, April 30, 2017: I think this bug happens when previewing content that contains <code>iframe</code> or <code>script</code> tags. When both the source code and rendered tags are sent to the browser, Google Chrome blocks the submission. It should now be possible to reproduce the bug by posting a comment here on this site (using Google Chrome) and previewing the content before submitting it.
