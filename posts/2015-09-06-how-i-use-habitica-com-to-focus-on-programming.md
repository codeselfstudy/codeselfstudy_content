title: How I Use Habitica.com to Focus on Programming

I've started using <a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica.com</a> (formerly HabitRPG) to manage my to-do lists. It turns your to-do list into a role playing game.

If you aren't familiar with Habitica, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/57654086">this video tutorial</a>.

Basically, you divide your to-do items into three categories:

<ol>
    <li>Habits -- things that you want to do regularly</li>
    <li>Dailies -- things that you want to do every day</li>
    <li>To-dos -- one-time tasks</li>
</ol>

I want to become better at focusing on reading and programming. In my "dailies" section, I added pomodoro-style reading and programming sessions. Basically, I set a <a href="http://www.marinaratimer.com/">25-minute timer</a> and either read or program. I click the plus sign for every 25-minute study session.

I also keep a reading list in the "to-do" section. The main item is called "September Reading List" and it has checkboxes for each book that I intend to finish by the end of the month.

Habitica is Free software, licensed under the GPL 3. You can <a href="https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg">contribute to the code via Github</a>.

A few of us have a Code Self Study party on Habitica. If you would like to join, email your Habitica username to josh@codeselfstudy.com and I'll add you.

I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, but it's making me at least a bit more productive. Give it a try!
