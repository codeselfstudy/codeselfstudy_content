Last night I went to Python night at OpenDNS where Zed Shaw was speaking about learning Python. Here are some notes from the presentation:

If you're a complete beginner with programming start with Python 2 and go through <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>. After that get <a href="http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/">Learning Python</a> by Mark Lutz. After those two books pick another book on a Python topic. Some examples mentioned were:

* Python for Data Analysis
* The Flask Book
* Programming the Raspberry Pi: Getting Started with Python
* Two Scoops of Django
* The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena ("The best algorithms book I've found.") Implement the algorithms in Python.
* Violent Python
* Then make a clone of something you like. Examples: Amazon, Twitter, Tinder, or whatever.

For people who already know another language, he recommended skipping Learn Python the Hard Way and going straight to Learning Python by Mark Lutz or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/">the Python tutorial</a>.

After that, get The Python Cookbook and build something. Examples given: log parser, web application, chat client, etc. And/or reimplement something that you're built before.

Other books mentioned were this one on <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/book/978-0-387-00163-0">programming challenges</a> and something on building compilers, but I didn't catch the title.

Another good tip was to code every day even if it's just for an hour or two.
