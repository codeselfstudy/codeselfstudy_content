title: Programming Notes Wiki
date: 2014-10-12

I've added a <a href="http://codeselfstudy.com/wiki/Main_Page">programming wiki</a> to the site. Members can use it to collaboratively take notes. Taking notes in the wiki provides quick reference notes for later. Examples: <a href="http://codeselfstudy.com/wiki/JavaScript_Basics">JavaScript basics</a> and <a href="http://codeselfstudy.com/wiki/Django">Django</a>.

All wiki content is under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the same license as Wikipedia</a>.

If anyone wants a wiki-editing account, leave a comment below and we'll create an account for you.
