I don't know of any programming bootcamps or open hackerspaces in the Berkeley or El Cerrito area. The <a href="https://codeselfstudy.com/edu">educational center that I'm proposing</a> with CodeSelfStudy is not a coding bootcamp or a hackerspace, but it overlaps enough that it could function as a coding bootcamp alternative for people who want to learn web development.

Interested in the idea? Check out <a href="https://codeselfstudy.com/edu">the proposal</a> and leave a comment below!
